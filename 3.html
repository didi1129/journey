    <h2>Memo 3</h2>
    <h3>The birth of the web</h3>


   <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989. The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automatic information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.</p>

<p>The first website at CERN - and in the world - was dedicated to the World Wide Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer. The website described the basic features of the web; how to access other people's documents and how to set up your own server. The NeXT machine - the original web server - is still at CERN.  As part of the <a href="http://first-website.web.cern.ch/">project to restore the first website</a>, in 2013 CERN reinstated the world's first website to its original address.
</p>

<p>On 30 April 1993 CERN put the  World Wide Web software in the public domain. CERN made the next release available with an open licence, as a more sure way to maximise its dissemination. Through these actions, making the software required to run a web server freely available, along with a <a href="http://line-mode.cern.ch">basic browser</a> and a library of code, the web was allowed to flourish.
