    <h2>JOURNEY</h2></a>
  <br>
  I've heard the online class since 3 days ago (15/05/18). Its name is 'Python Foundation 1'.

  <p>Teacherboy was not bad. He taught easily and the lecture resources were simple and not corny.</p>

  <p>But I think Coding is a little bit difficult.</p>

  <p>At the first day of the class, it was a piece of a cake. But It's getting more and more difficult as the days go by. </p>
  <p style="margin-top:-10px;">Today's contents were the most difficult things of the whole lectures. (Of course, today is the last day of the class!)</p>

  <p>I can't understand the function 'append' and 'for iteration'.</p>

  <p>I hope it will be easier as I study more.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Also, it was too bad that the class curriculum has only four lectures.</p>

  <p>It has a follow-up class named 'Python Foundation 2', but I couldn't have enrolled because it was already closed on May 6. I don't know when it'll be reopened.</p>
  <br>
  <strong>Whatever. <u>It will work out somehow.</u></strong>
